            There are lots of constraints.
            1 When we turn the bulb on (>800w) we aren't allowed to turn
              it off for 15m because the Hg inside needs to fully evaporate
              But we can overrride.
            2 When we turn the bulb off, we need to wait 15m for the Hg to
              recondense before we can turn it on again.
            3 When we turn on, we go to maximum brightness for 2 seconds and
              then drop back down.
            4 1200w is the maximum brightness, and requesting higher will
              produce an error.
            5 800w is the minimum, and requesting lower is the same as

            ----------
